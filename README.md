# sudoku-solver
A C++ program that solves any solvable Sudoku right in the terminal!

This is a fast and efficent Sudoku puzzle solver! Made on Jan 5, 2023 in my Christmas Break!
  
    This program reads the incomplete Sudoku from the user input,
    and then uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution. 
    If a solution is found, it is printed to the console. 
    Otherwise, it prints "Unable to solve the Sudoku".
    
    Here is an example of a user input for an incomplete Sudoku:
    
    IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THERE IS SPACE BETWEEN EACH NUMBER!!!
    0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 4
    2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0
    0 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 5
    0 6 0 0 7 8 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    8 0 0 0 3 9 2 7 0
    0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 7
    0 0 4 9 8 6 0 0 1
    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    Please attempt to solve the Sudoku yourself first ;)
